The purpose of Lab 1 is to explore the IT1025 course set-up, examine the history of computing and get up and running with GitHub. IT1025 covers a wide-range of computing topics with a primary goal of assisting in determining student passions in IT.  IT history has many interesting facets. One of particular interest was... Regardless of one's passion in IT, frameworks such as GitHub are useful to create, update and maintain any type of file and work in an organized repository.

## Information System Components
The five components of information systems are hardware, software, data, people, and processes. Hardware is the physical parts of information systems, composed of objects like computers, keyboards, and hard drives. Software is a group of instructions that control what the hardware does, it consists of operating systems and application software. Data is a group of facts put together, consisting of information about someone or something. The people are a big contribution to information systems, they consist of people like developers, officers, and support staff. Lastly, the process is a series of steps that help achieve a goal in the system.
## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
Client-Server is a way to connect an application or a device to a mainframe called a server. Servers control the things that people are able to do with their device. They also allow different people to access the same data as each other. GitHub uses Client-Server architecture as it controls some things that we can see and it also allows us to interact with one another.
### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing allows people to easily access the same data from multiple places rather than from just their PC. It allows them to use the same data from their PC on their phones or other mobile devices.
## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
The Hard Drive Latency is the average time it takes for a sector being assesed to move into a position under a head after a seek. The Seek Time is the amount of time for a hard drive to read and write a head. The Hard Drive Transfer Rate is the speed that data is transfered to (and from) disk media. Host transfer rate is the speed that a host computer can transfer information to another computer.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
#### Random Access Memory
### ALU and the Control Unit
### CPU, Input & Output
### Logic Gates 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

## Conclusion

Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
