The purpose of Lab 1 is to explore the IT1025 course set-up, examine the history of computing and get up and running with GitHub. IT1025 covers a wide-range of computing topics with a primary goal of assisting in determining student passions in IT.  IT history has many interesting facets. One of particular interest was... Regardless of one's passion in IT, frameworks such as GitHub are useful to create, update and maintain any type of file and work in an organized repository.

## Information System Components
The five components of information systems are hardware, software, data, people, and processes. Hardware is the physical parts of information systems, composed of objects like computers, keyboards, and hard drives. Software is a group of instructions that control what the hardware does, it consists of operating systems and application software. Data is a group of facts put together, consisting of information about someone or something. The people are a big contribution to information systems, they consist of people like developers, officers, and support staff. Lastly, the process is a series of steps that help achieve a goal in the system.
## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
Client-Server is a way to connect an application or a device to a mainframe called a server. Servers control the things that people are able to do with their device. They also allow different people to access the same data as each other. GitHub uses Client-Server architecture as it controls some things that we can see and it also allows us to interact with one another.
### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing allows people to easily access the same data from multiple places rather than from just their PC. It allows them to use the same data from their PC on their phones or other mobile devices.
## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
The Hard Drive Latency is the average time it takes for a sector being assesed to move into a position under a head after a seek. The Seek Time is the amount of time for a hard drive to read and write a head. The Hard Drive Transfer Rate is the speed that data is transferred to (and from) disk media. Host transfer rate is the speed that a host computer can transfer information to another computer.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Traditional Hard Drives are made up of many moving parts including pieces like heads and spindles. They have many needs that they must meet in order to read or write data, including being properly clean and their disk must be spinning. Solid State Hard drives are a much easier way of storing and using data. They don't use any moving parts and instead stores data with memory. Solid State Drives use NAND or SDRAM as they can do the same functions that the hard drives disk can do. Solid state drives can access data much faster than normal hard drives are able to. Also, they are less likely to break than normal hard drives are and are more likely to work well.
#### Random Access Memory
Increasing the RAM makes a computer run faster because it increases the memory. If the memory is too low then some information must be stored on the hard drive instead of moving directly to the computer. Increasing the RAM allows information to be moved off of the hard drive and to the computer, increasing the speed of the computer. 64 or 32 bit data paths mean the amount of bits that are transferred in a clock cycle. 64 bit data paths are able to transfer 64 bits in a clock cycle while 32 bit data paths transfer 32 bits in a clock cycle, the more bits transferred means that you will have a faster computer.
### ALU and the Control Unit
If the ALU wanted to put two of its inputs together the Control Unit would receive the command from the RAM and then the Control Unit would tell the ALU what to do. After this the ALU would perform that action and output the answer. Sometimes the ALU won't output an answer if it's a compare command, instead it would just tell the Control Unit how the imputs compare. After this the ALU would use flags to help the Control Unit decide what to do next. The ALU can also store answers in a register, which is connected to the ALU. In order to save the data in the register the Control Unit must turn on the set wire. To retrieve the data the Control Unit must turn on the enable wire, allowing the data to be shared.
### CPU, Input & Output
The CPU when you're filling up gas would be the dollar counter in the gas tank, which would determine the cost for how much fuel you input. The input would be the fuel itself, you'd be inputting the fuel to make the car run. The output would be that your car would drive and it would emit CO2.
### Logic Gates 
A truth table is a table that shows the output for every input, these are made up of ones and zeros. AND tables will only have an output of one if all of the inputs are one, otherwise it will have an output of zero. On the otherhand, OR tables will always have an output of one unless all of the inputs are zero.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE's main goal is to improve technology in the world. They employ many kinds of jobs now, like doctors and physicists, rather than just engineers. IEEE's approaches to ethics is very powerful. They want to create a fair working space for their engineers and employees as well as bring attention to many ethical problems.They also want to try and help their workers succeed by helping them with their education.
## Conclusion

Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
